# OpenDota webhook API

## Introduction
OpenDota offers users the possibility to register webhooks, 
allowing you to get notified whenever a game gets detected and parsed.
Each subscription has to specify one or multiple criteria the webhook
is subscribing to. The available criteria are:

* Player ID (Dota2 account ID)
* League ID
* Team ID

You can subscribe to any combination of the above criteria and of course,
multiple of the same ones. Each time a match is scanned or parsed that
contains a player, league, team whose ID you've subscribed to, the result
will get posted to your webhook. It has the same format a call to the 
`/matches` endpoint would get you, with an additional `origin` field
indicating whether the match was scanned or parsed. 

## Webhook management endpoints

In order to call any of the following endpoints, you must be authenticated.
This means that you must have a valid Steam OpenID 2.0 session on the 
`opendota.com` domain
